## Manages social profiles

<h2 align="center"></h2>

A menu driven program called project_base_file.py that will allow the user to enter commands and process these commands until the quit command is entered.

The program will store and maintain personal profile information (using a List of Profile objects). Personal profile information will be stored in a text file that will be read in when the program commences.
Once the initial profile data has been read in from the file, the program should allow the user to
interactively query and manipulate the profile information.

## Input
--- 
When your program begins, it will read in personal profile information from a file called profiles.txt.
This is a text file that stores profile information for the simple social network.
